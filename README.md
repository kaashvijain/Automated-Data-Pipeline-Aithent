# Automated Data Pipeline
Automated Data Pipeline was a project I developed and worked on during my time in Aithent Inc. This project implements an end-to-end automated workflow for data management (eg. students). It streamlines database operations, data export to CSV, email notifications, and analytics chart generation using Oracle, Java, and Python. 

## Features 
- Automatic student ID generation using Oracle sequences and triggers
- PL/SQL procedure for exporting student data to CSV files with dynamic date-based filenames
- Modular Java programs for database connection, procedure execution, and email sending
- Python script for converting CSV files to Excel and generating pivot charts
- One-command execution for end-to-end data export, distribution, and visualization

## Technologies Used
- Oracle SQL Developer, PL/SQL
- Java (JDBC, JavaMail API)
- Python (pandas, openpyxl, matplotlib)

## Workflow

## Future Enhancements 
- Schedule exports and email via cron jobs
- Integrate a lightweight UI for end-users
- Support for cloud storage (Google Drive, Dropbox, etc.)
